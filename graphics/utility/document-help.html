      <h1>Document help</h1>
      <p class="lead">If anyone knows how shitty life gets, it's me. I've known a lot of folks over the years that for whatever reason just needed help producing/changing/altering a document, reciept, invoice and so on. More often than not, these folks have zero word processing ability or computer experience, and have virtually zero hope of producing a solution. Enter groovy's document help service.</p>
      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>This service is provided for movie prop and prank joke situations only. Not to be used for real-life, illegal or con artist stuff. What you do with it is beyond my control, but by tipping me for any help, you consent that you will not use this for anything bad and that I am free and clear of any of your getting in trouble bullshit.</p>
      <h2>Faqs</h2>
      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>You have a need -- however crazy -- and you email me confidentially your plight.</p>
      <h3>What should I do if you can't help me?</h3>
      <p>If I'm unable to help, I'll let you know right away.</p>
      <h3>What if I need help with something very very 'questionable'?</h3>
      <p>For the most part, I really don't care what type of thing you're in need of. Your business is not my business and business is business. That said -- if you send me something rediculously illegal, involving some kind of trafficing of minors or trying to photoshop out the name of the hitman you hired to off paw and get into his safe, I mean I'm gonna have to report that shit. I don't care about your "F&@# PETA in the butt" poster... just use some common sense. In other words, I don't want to see your ass go to jail, but I'm also not going to jail for your ass.</p>
